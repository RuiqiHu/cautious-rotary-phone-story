There is a happy little boy named Henry. He lives beside the beach. Then he began his journey in America.

His journey starts at Madison, WI. Even though Madison isn't a big city, there are still some place for him to visit, such as UW campus.

Henry went many places on the UW campus, including Memorial Union, Camp Randall, Birge Hall, and State St. His favorite place to go
was Memorial Union, because eating outside by the water reminded him of his home by the beach. After attending a badger football game,
Henry decides it is time to visit other cities in America. He begins looking for plane tickets to other places that he wants to visit.

Henry decides to visit New York City, as he has heard a lot of great things about how big the city is. Once Henry gets
to new york, he visits the statue of liberty and the empire state building. Henry soon realizes however, that he is lost and does not know how to figure out where he is!

He asked a stranger where the airport was. After 3 hours, he finally took the airplane and went back to Madison. He decided to stay at this little city for 3 years because he found this place very cozy.
